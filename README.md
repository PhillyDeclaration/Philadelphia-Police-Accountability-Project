# Philadelphia-Police-Accountability-Project
Archive of data about civilian Complaints Against Police (CAPS) posted on rolling basis by the City of Philadelphia.

Update 7/2/2018: Today, we corrected an error in the ppd_complaint_complainants_3-18.csv dataset. Specifically, the data in the columns for complainant_age and complaint_initials were switched. This has now been corrected. The corrected file is named ppd_complaint_complainants_3-18_corrected.csv. Additionally, from the date of our first backup post until today, the Philadelphia Police have not posted any new data, despite their promise to update on a monthly basis.
